<p><strong>14:15:34</strong>, <em>Student 0</em>: yes</p>
<p><strong>14:26:46</strong>, <em>Student 1</em>: so the exam will be closed book in presence form. Will a single page of cheatsheet be allowed?</p>

<p><strong>14:59:53</strong>, <em>Student 1</em>: how did you submit the password?</p>
<p><strong>15:00:12</strong>, <em>Student 1</em>: cause the submit button never works</p>
<p><strong>15:16:31</strong>, <em>Student 1</em>: oh ok</p>
<p><strong>15:33:10</strong>, <em>Student 2</em>: Okay I see. Thank you!</p>
