<p><strong>14:14:00</strong>, <em>Student 0</em>: yes</p>
<p><strong>14:14:01</strong>, <em>Student 1</em>: ping</p>
<p><strong>14:14:02</strong>, <em>Student 2</em>: ping</p>
<p><strong>14:14:03</strong>, <em>Student 3</em>: works</p>
<p><strong>14:14:04</strong>, <em>Student 4</em>: pong</p>
<p><strong>14:17:59</strong>, <em>Student 5</em>: y</p>
<p><strong>14:21:00</strong>, <em>Student 6</em>: Will there by programming assignments? Or hacking experiences?</p>
<p><strong>14:21:11</strong>, <em>Student 0</em>: will Solutions of exercises be published as pdf?</p>
<p><strong>14:21:40</strong>, <em>Student 7</em>: The solutions are already on moodle</p>
<p><strong>14:21:44</strong>, <em>Student 8</em>: Yes, there will be hands-on exercises, in which you get to hack vulnerable systems.</p>
<p><strong>14:22:02</strong>, <em>Student 8</em>: +1: The solutions will be posted online.</p>
<p><strong>14:22:12</strong>, <em>Student 8</em>: Along with a recording of the tutorial.</p>
<p><strong>14:23:51</strong>, <em>Student 9</em>: Can you please a lot upload the chat log (as some questions asked in chat are answered as text), thus it doesn’t appear in video recordings. I am referring both to lecture as well as tutorial session.</p>
<p><strong>14:24:41</strong>, <em>Student 8</em>: I think you can save the chat log.</p>
<p><strong>14:24:42</strong>, <em>Student 10</em>: The lecture Chats are on moodle</p>
<p><strong>14:25:35</strong>, <em>Student 8</em>: There’s a button on the top-right corner of your typing space that allows you to (a) send files, and (b) save chat. And the lecture chats should be on moodle, as well. :)</p>
<p><strong>14:26:14</strong>, <em>Student 11</em>: would privacy not also deal with misuse of personal data by the data processor? like an app using personal data in a way the user did not consent to? (not necessary leaking it)</p>
<p><strong>14:26:19</strong>, <em>Student 12</em>: Ignore the file, I tried to save the chat :D</p>
<p><strong>14:27:13</strong>, <em>Student 13</em>: Isn’t a Confidentiality violation also a Privacy violation? e.g if my password is violated, chances are that also my personal data will be violated</p>
<p><strong>14:28:20</strong>, <em>Student 8</em>: <span class="citation" data-cites="Student">@Student</span> 11 + Student 13: Yes, sure. The moral of this comparison is to make the distinction between confidentiality and privacy in terms of their relation to your “personal” data.</p>
<p><strong>14:28:43</strong>, <em>Student 8</em>: For example, your address or gender are more related to “private” information.</p>
<p><strong>14:28:57</strong>, <em>Student 8</em>: However, leaking them is indeed a matter of violating confidentiality.</p>
<p><strong>14:29:13</strong>, <em>Student 8</em>: So, there’s a decent overlap between both concepts when it comes to the secrecy of information.</p>
<p><strong>14:29:52</strong>, <em>Student 8</em>: But the primary distinction we attempt to make is vis-a-vis their relationship to the user.</p>
<p><strong>14:30:03</strong>, <em>Student 8</em>: Does it make sense?</p>
<p><strong>14:30:28</strong>, <em>Student 14</em>: If I say that both safety and security want to keep a harmless condition, but they work in two different directions(one is inside–&gt; outside, the other the opposite), is it correct?</p>
<p><strong>14:30:29</strong>, <em>Student 15</em>: what is vis-a-vis?</p>
<p><strong>14:30:33</strong>, <em>Student 16</em>: would this be a satisfactory answer for Question b):</p>
<p>Difference: Security is about preventing attacks from outside the systems (external). Safety is about preventing faulty behavior from within the system.  Similarity: Both try to prevent unintended behavior of a system and the potentially resulting harmful consequences. Both try to protect the integrity of the system.</p>
<p><strong>14:30:34</strong>, <em>Student 13</em>: I think so, Privacy is related to personal data, while Confidentiality to information relative to the user</p>
<p><strong>14:31:01</strong>, <em>Student 8</em>: <span class="citation" data-cites="Student">@Student</span> 13: Correct.</p>
<p><strong>14:31:14</strong>, <em>Student 8</em>: <span class="citation" data-cites="Student">@Student</span> 15: vis-a-vis == with regard to</p>
<p><strong>14:32:01</strong>, <em>Student 8</em>: <span class="citation" data-cites="Student">@Student</span> 14 + Student 16: The main difference here is having an adversary/attacker that deliberately attacks the system.</p>
<p><strong>14:32:27</strong>, <em>Student 8</em>: The Boeing 737 MAX issues were faults == related to safety.</p>
<p><strong>14:32:54</strong>, <em>Student 8</em>: But if someone deliberately crashes a plane (e.g., German wings crash), that’s security.</p>
<p><strong>14:33:13</strong>, <em>Student 8</em>: Defending both issues sometimes overlap. But the difference is in the intention, so to speak.</p>
<p><strong>14:38:32</strong>, <em>Student 17</em>: Typo, “now” used instead of “know”.</p>
<p><strong>14:38:52</strong>, <em>Student 8</em>: <span class="citation" data-cites="Student">@Student</span> 17: Thanks :)</p>
<p><strong>14:40:54</strong>, <em>Student 7</em>: does it not also depend on the user of the system? and as humans are involved, the uncertainty will always prevail ?</p>
<p><strong>14:42:45</strong>, <em>Student 5</em>: y</p>
<p><strong>14:42:45</strong>, <em>Student 2</em>: ping</p>
<p><strong>14:42:45</strong>, <em>Student 1</em>: yes</p>
<p><strong>14:42:46</strong>, <em>Student 15</em>: &lt;</p>
<p><strong>14:43:38</strong>, <em>Student 8</em>: <span class="citation" data-cites="Student">@Student</span> 7: It absolutely does, good point. Hence, it can never be 100% secure.</p>
<p><strong>14:44:16</strong>, <em>Student 12</em>: But is it a system flaw if a user leakes for example a password?</p>
<p><strong>14:44:29</strong>, <em>Student 12</em>: I would say no</p>
<p><strong>14:45:16</strong>, <em>Student 8</em>: <span class="citation" data-cites="Student">@Student</span> 12: Good question. That depends on what you define as a system. If you include users in this, then the “system” is not secure. Usually, you try to accommodate for such scenarios.</p>
<p><strong>14:45:39</strong>, <em>Student 8</em>: But at some point, you cannot do a lot to maintain the security of the system. It just turns into “damage control”</p>
<p><strong>14:46:14</strong>, <em>Student 8</em>: If your admin goes rogue and decides to drop your databases, maybe you can try to do backups and give access to different admins.</p>
<p><strong>14:46:23</strong>, <em>Student 8</em>: If all of them go rogue, we’re screwed! :D</p>
<p><strong>14:49:18</strong>, <em>Student 12</em>: The slides seem to be cut off on the right, or is it just me?</p>
<p><strong>14:49:25</strong>, <em>Student 18</em>: Same for me</p>
<p><strong>14:49:25</strong>, <em>Student 15</em>: true</p>
<p><strong>14:49:28</strong>, <em>Student 19</em>: can confrim</p>
<p><strong>14:49:31</strong>, <em>Student 13</em>: Slightly on the bottom too</p>
<p><strong>14:51:13</strong>, <em>Student 20</em>: How are Fail-Safe Defaults and Implicit Deny related? I don’t see why they are combined in one principle</p>
<p><strong>14:51:16</strong>, <em>Student 13</em>: If a database transaction fails/is interrupted and is “restored” to a default, is that considered a fail-safe default?</p>
<p><strong>14:53:06</strong>, <em>Student 15</em>: khoa</p>
<p><strong>14:53:08</strong>, <em>Student 17</em>: Why: Negative Example: Blacklisting of ports/websites, where we implicitly deny some ports being open instead of by default being open ?</p>
<p><strong>14:53:08</strong>, <em>Student 15</em>: oops</p>
<p><strong>14:53:53</strong>, <em>Student 8</em>: <span class="citation" data-cites="Student">@Student</span> 20: “The Principle of Fail-Safe Defaults states that, unless a subject is given explicit access to an object, it should be denied access to that object.” == implicit deny.</p>
<p><strong>14:54:53</strong>, <em>Student 8</em>: <span class="citation" data-cites="Student">@Student</span> 13: Nope, it’s basically implicity deny said in a confusing manner, I have to admit.</p>
<p><strong>14:55:25</strong>, <em>Student 12</em>: Isn’t blacklisting explicit deny?</p>
<p><strong>14:55:49</strong>, <em>Student 8</em>: <span class="citation" data-cites="Student">@Student</span> 17: Blacklisting is explicit deny .. yup, exactly Korbinian.</p>
<p><strong>14:56:29</strong>, <em>Student 8</em>: With blacklisting, you have to always add new things to block and you cannot cope. It does not scale.</p>
<p><strong>14:56:54</strong>, <em>Student 8</em>: It’s easier to say, block everything unless I allow them, which should be much smaller in number than the other way around.</p>
<p><strong>14:57:06</strong>, <em>Student 8</em>: It’s a paranoid approach. But works alright. :)</p>
<p><strong>14:57:27</strong>, <em>Student 21</em>: So economy of mechanism tend to be beneficial for users instead of system itself?</p>
<p><strong>14:58:26</strong>, <em>Student 8</em>: <span class="citation" data-cites="Student">@Student</span> 21: For both. For developers: it makes it easier to understand the system and decreases the chances of getting something wrong and maybe less secure.</p>
<p><strong>14:58:34</strong>, <em>Student 7</em>: isn’t fail-safe defaults about starting a system in a secure state and return to a secure default state in case of failures?</p>
<p><strong>14:59:08</strong>, <em>Student 8</em>: For users: if the mechanism interfaces with users, then it should be simple == usable (e.g.,password reset module).</p>
<p><strong>15:00:26</strong>, <em>Student 22</em>: Can you give another example for Least Common Mechanism? I’m still not sure if I understand it correctly</p>
<p><strong>15:00:44</strong>, <em>Student 8</em>: <span class="citation" data-cites="Student">@Student</span> 7: I get the point. It literally sounds like that. But I actually think it is not.</p>
<p><strong>15:02:20</strong>, <em>Student 8</em>: <span class="citation" data-cites="Student">@Student</span> 22: consider password policies. The harder it is, the more secure against brut-force attacks it is. But eventually users will write passwords down because they are complex, effectively undermining the security of their accounts and maybe the system.</p>
<p><strong>15:02:57</strong>, <em>Student 8</em>: Simply put, “economy of mechanism” means that a security mechanism should be as simple as possible.</p>
<p><strong>15:04:07</strong>, <em>Student 19</em>: <span class="citation" data-cites="alei">@alei</span> could you let Patrick now about the cut off slides? he could just go into presentation mode</p>
<p><strong>15:04:25</strong>, <em>Student 8</em>: <span class="citation" data-cites="Student">@Student</span> 19: sure. Let me raise my hand. :)</p>
<p><strong>15:07:28</strong>, <em>Student 19</em>: thanks</p>
<p><strong>15:07:36</strong>, <em>Student 8</em>: Sure thing</p>
<p><strong>15:09:36</strong>, <em>Student 23</em>: Could you please give another example for Least common mechanism, apart from 2FA as given in the solution</p>
<p><strong>15:09:37</strong>, <em>Student 16</em>: What is “hearbleed” (p.26)?</p>
<p><strong>15:09:45</strong>, <em>Student 19</em>: +1</p>
<p><strong>15:10:00</strong>, <em>Student 5</em>: <a href="https://heartbleed.com/">https://heartbleed.com/</a></p>
<p><strong>15:10:51</strong>, <em>Student 22</em>: Is Economy of Mechanism and Defense in Depth also okay as answer?</p>
<p><strong>15:11:02</strong>, <em>Student 13</em>: Are there other possible answers to question d?</p>
<p><strong>15:11:08</strong>, <em>Student 13</em>: Just a curiosity</p>
<p><strong>15:11:36</strong>, <em>Student 12</em>: I would say Economy of Mechanism and Defense in Depth can create a conflict</p>
<p><strong>15:12:48</strong>, <em>Student 8</em>: @ Student 22 + Student 12: I would say so too.</p>
<p><strong>15:13:02</strong>, <em>Student 14</em>: aren’t also least common and complete mediation incorporated?</p>
<p><strong>15:13:29</strong>, <em>Student 8</em>: <span class="citation" data-cites="Student">@Student</span> 23: let me think of one example.</p>
<p><strong>15:13:51</strong>, <em>Student 22</em>: Isn’t Least common mechanism(all in one network so you can access all the resources in the same way) also one neglected principle?</p>
<p><strong>15:15:24</strong>, <em>Student 8</em>: <span class="citation" data-cites="Student">@Student</span> 14: Just not to answer the wrong question. What do you mean by “incoporated”. Like Least common include Complete mediation?</p>
<p><strong>15:15:52</strong>, <em>Student 11</em>: could one not say that compartmentlaization is partially done, because wile the network is not split, duties are separated across servers? (different server for web and DB)</p>
<p><strong>15:17:28</strong>, <em>Student 11</em>: and would “least common mechanism” not be violated as well, as both internal employees and users access over the same route + the mailserver intended for internal use is made publicly available?</p>
<p><strong>15:17:41</strong>, <em>Student 14</em>: <span class="citation" data-cites="Alei">@Alei</span> I mean these two mechanisms incorporated into the system</p>
<p><strong>15:18:12</strong>, <em>Student 22</em>: Feedback: Can Patrick Stöckle also please include the written questions? Not everyone has a microphone and I don’t think you can answer the questions in Chat in an adequate and lengthy way, just because of the format</p>
<p><strong>15:21:16</strong>, <em>Student 8</em>: <span class="citation" data-cites="Student">@Student</span> 11: Good point. Usually, mail servers are kept within the internal network rater than the DMZ. So, ideally, there should be separate servers to maintain the least common mechanism.</p>
<p><strong>15:22:40</strong>, <em>Student 23</em>: It was least common mechanism</p>
<p><strong>15:24:11</strong>, <em>Student 8</em>: <span class="citation" data-cites="Student">@Student</span> 14: Ah-a! Firewalls should represent complete mediation. Least common mechanism: as Felix discussed, maybe not always.</p>
<p><strong>15:24:20</strong>, <em>Student 8</em>: <span class="citation" data-cites="Student">@Student</span> 23: Yup, sorry.</p>
<p><strong>15:25:21</strong>, <em>Student 4</em>: Navy Seal Copypasta</p>
<p><strong>15:25:23</strong>, <em>Student 18</em>: Hahaha</p>
<p><strong>15:25:27</strong>, <em>Student 2</em>: is this a joke ?</p>
<p><strong>15:25:34</strong>, <em>Student 5</em>: lmao</p>
<p><strong>15:25:37</strong>, <em>Student 8</em>: Okay, I have no freaking idea what was that!! :D</p>
<p><strong>15:25:43</strong>, <em>Student 4</em>: <a href="https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/navy-seal-copypasta">https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/navy-seal-copypasta</a></p>
<p><strong>15:25:51</strong>, <em>Student 24</em>: mashallah brother</p>
<p><strong>15:26:06</strong>, <em>Student 8</em>: <span class="citation" data-cites="Student">@Student</span> 4: thanks for the info :’D</p>
<p><strong>15:26:47</strong>, <em>Student 25</em>: xD</p>
<p><strong>15:27:10</strong>, <em>Student 23</em>: So if I got it right, least common mechanism is incorporated in the bank example as there are dedicated servers for the data, applications and mailing functionalities?</p>
<p><strong>15:27:34</strong>, <em>Student 8</em>: It would be awesome if someone brute-forced this meeting’s key an we’re talking about “security”!</p>
<p><strong>15:28:51</strong>, <em>Student 8</em>: <span class="citation" data-cites="Student">@Student</span> 23: right to a great extent. But as Felix mentioned, employees and external users using the same mailing server may violate this principle.</p>
<p><strong>15:29:28</strong>, <em>Student 8</em>: <span class="citation" data-cites="everyone">@everyone</span>: Obviously, this is a hypothetical architecture. So, feel free to point out any problems with it.</p>
<p><strong>15:31:13</strong>, <em>Student 7</em>: how is compartmentalization diff from least common mechanism ?</p>
<p><strong>15:31:50</strong>, <em>Student 24</em>: the eva articulations innit</p>
<p><strong>15:32:35</strong>, <em>Student 14</em>: in the email, is it better to retrieve the exact name of the recipient, so that we can address the mail better and it sounds more realistic?</p>
<p><strong>15:33:17</strong>, <em>Student 8</em>: <span class="citation" data-cites="Student">@Student</span> 7: Compartmentalization isolates processes/users/subjects on a need-to-know basis. So, you only have access to what you need and that’s it.</p>
<p><strong>15:34:09</strong>, <em>Student 8</em>: Least common is about access to the same resources. So, if we (as users) are perfectly isolated, there should be a wy thata we share the same resources.</p>
<p><strong>15:35:21</strong>, <em>Student 8</em>: Obviously, users logged in to a single server share the same resources on the server (e.g., memory), but they cannot access one-another’s sessions.</p>
<p><strong>15:37:05</strong>, <em>Student 8</em>: <span class="citation" data-cites="Student">@Student</span> 14: Well, I guess it depends on who you’re targeting. If you are targeting John Doe in particular, it would be better to include his name in he temail.</p>
<p><strong>15:37:37</strong>, <em>Student 8</em>: Otherwise, a lot of users will be satisfied with a general email ’a la “Dear client, …”</p>
<p><strong>15:37:49</strong>, <em>Student 8</em>: Nowadays, automated emails are widely used anyway.</p>
<p><strong>15:39:08</strong>, <em>Student 8</em>: Any other questions?</p>
