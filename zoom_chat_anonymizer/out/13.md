**15:21:37**, *Student 0*: I think adversarial ML models (for Image detection) change more than just one Pixel - it's just really small pertubations on many Pixels so that they aren't visible for the human eye

**15:22:12**, *Student 1*: Is it only me or is only the second part (Intrusion) of the new chapter uploaded on moodle?

**15:22:20**, *Student 2*: same here

**15:22:27**, *Student 0*: yep

**15:27:44**, *Student 3*: the slides in moodle are the IDS slides (next lecture) under the wrong name as it seems...

**15:28:52**, *Student 0*: ah nice now I see them too

**15:28:56**, *Student 0*: thanks

**15:30:13**, *Patrick St√∂ckle*: @Student 1: I updated moodle. Now, there should be misconfiguration and intrusion detection systems

**15:30:54**, *Student 1*: thx

**15:31:30**, *Student 4*: thanks!
