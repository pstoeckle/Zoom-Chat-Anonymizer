**14:04:27**, *Student 0*: Did the lecture already start ?

**14:04:49**, *Student 1*: obviously not

**14:04:51**, *Student 2*: it's scheduled to start at 14:15

**14:05:20**, *Student 0*: Okay i thought I had some technical problems

**14:05:27**, *Student 0*: thank you

**14:21:20**, *Student 3*: Is there a reason that the left Router/Switch is not highlighted in yellow?

**14:22:44**, *Patrick Stöckle*: No, the left router should also be highlighted

**14:23:08**, *Patrick Stöckle*: Idea: Principles are important for all components

**14:31:31**, *Student 4*: can sql injection be a way not to respect complete mediation?

**14:35:47**, *Student 5*: What's the difference between a secure state and a secure default state ?

**14:38:47**, *Patrick Stöckle*: SQL injections can be an example for a violation of this principle, yes. If there are sanitisation mechanisms, which should prevent malicious queries from going through and an attack can inject his malicious queries via SQL injection, the principle is violated.

**14:43:06**, *Patrick Stöckle*: > What's the difference between a secure state and a secure default state ? Our system can have several secure states and, of course, several insecure states. The idea here is that 1. our system starts in a secure state and 2. that in case of an error our system is going to a secure state, the secure default state. The secure starting state does not have to be the same state as the secure default state and not every state has to return to the same secure default state.

**14:43:44**, *Patrick Stöckle*: What we don’t want is that the attacker can create an exception, the system is set back to an insecure state, and the attacker can exploit that.

**14:44:51**, *Student 5*: Thank you :)

**14:45:00**, *Student 4*: Thanks

**14:59:46**, *Student 4*: For the submission of our solution of the exercises, does the pdf has to be built via latex?

**15:02:18**, *Patrick Stöckle*: No, you can use whatever you want, but PDF as output format is preferable

**15:03:02**, *Student 4*: thanks

**15:04:54**, *Student 6*: will Solutions be published for the exercises?

**15:08:35**, *Patrick Stöckle*: Current state is that we will publish at least the recordings of the tutorials, so yes

**15:08:53**, *Student 6*: thank you

**15:33:16**, *Student 7*: Is there an advantage in terms of password security not to use the mnemonic itself instead of just the initials?

**15:33:51**, *Student 2*: dictionary attacks are possible, but not very common

**15:35:15**, *Student 8*: What is your personal opinion on password mangers ? Do you recommend them?

**15:35:34**, *Student 9*: How are these "most common password" lists created? Are users providing their password or are they gathered some other way?

**15:37:16**, *Student 10*: Surveys basically

**15:37:33**, *Student 10*: and discovered in data breaches

**15:40:13**, *Patrick Stöckle*: > What is your personal opinion on password mangers ? Do you recommend them? I’m personally using a password manager. There are a lot of good solutions out there. The categories for my password manager of choice were: Passwords are not stored in the „cloud“; it should be open-source software

**15:40:21**, *Patrick Stöckle*: > How are these "most common password" lists created? Are users providing their password or are they gathered some other way?

**15:40:50**, *Patrick Stöckle*: I would also argue for surveys and data breaches, but I will research that

**15:43:57**, *Student 11*: Mostly data breaches.

**15:44:09**, *Student 7*: Thanks

**15:45:02**, *Student 11*: [https://haveibeenpwned.com/Passwords](https://haveibeenpwned.com/Passwords)

**15:45:46**, *Student 11*: At least that's one source that collects passwords/emails exposed in data breaches.
