**14:57:38**, *Student 2*: Could you once again shortly explain the difference between a vulnerability and a threat?

**15:17:16**, *Student 3*: SQL injections are like 20 years old and it's so easy to prevent if one uses a more or less modern Approach, why is this still a thing?

**15:27:58**, *Patrick Stöckle*: @Student 3: Why it’s still on #1 of the OWASP Top Ten, we can only guess. (1) the sanitisation is usually not that easy, so maybe it’s the complexity. (2) it’s cumbersome to implement proper sanitisation, thus, it’s omitted. (3) maybe there are still people out there who are developing and are not aware of the fact that SQLIs are a problem to the security of system.
