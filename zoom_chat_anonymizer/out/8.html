<p><strong>14:45:14</strong>, <em>Student 0</em>: downpour</p>
<p><strong>14:46:43</strong>, <em>Patrick Stöckle</em>: <span class="citation" data-cites="Student">@Student</span> 0: what do you mean by that? Shall we slow down the speed of the lecture?</p>
<p><strong>14:46:48</strong>, <em>Student 1</em>: If your application has to communicate with a database, what would be the best practice to keep the database credentials secret? We learned that there is the keystore system on Android, but what about other platforms? <strong>Answered by Prof. Pretschner</strong></p>
<p><strong>14:48:31</strong>, <em>Student 0</em>: no sorry, was talking with a friend about the weather</p>
<p><strong>14:51:34</strong>, <em>Student 1</em>: Thank you! :)</p>
<p><strong>15:04:40</strong>, <em>Student 2</em>: Are there ways to merge checking and responding? Such that even upon a ‘successful’ check, the response cannot simply be replaced by <code>if (false) respond();</code> ? <strong>Answered by Prof. Pretschner</strong></p>
<p><strong>15:07:10</strong>, <em>Student 3</em>: Is it the task of a programmer to come up with the checkers or are they usually generated and hidden by another program? <strong>Answered by Prof. Pretschner</strong></p>
<p><strong>15:07:59</strong>, <em>Student 4</em>: are those Tools open source? or somewhere available</p>
<p><strong>15:12:11</strong>, <em>Patrick Stöckle</em>: <span class="citation" data-cites="Student">@Student</span> 4: Most of the software developed at our chair is open-source software. You can find most of them on our Software page (<a href="https://www.in.tum.de/i04/tools/">https://www.in.tum.de/i04/tools/),</a>,) e.g., for Oblivious hashing (<a href="https://github.com/tum-i22/sip-oblivious-hashing">https://github.com/tum-i22/sip-oblivious-hashing).</a>.)</p>
<p><strong>15:13:17</strong>, <em>Student 4</em>: tyy</p>
<p><strong>15:21:23</strong>, <em>Student 5</em>: Can self-checksumming be used in languages that don’t compile to machine instructions? E.g. JVM-based languages, Javascript, Python.</p>
<p><strong>15:30:34</strong>, <em>Student 4</em>: is it possible to stackwalk the stack of another thread in the same process? So if we have 1 thread doing Integrity checks can it Access another threads stack</p>
<p><strong>15:35:23</strong>, <em>Student 6</em>: <span class="citation" data-cites="Student">@Student</span> 5: Answer from Mohsen (our colleague who researchers this particular topic): “Question 1. Generally yes. One realisation would be to run integrity checks within the interpreter or hypervisor.”</p>
<p><strong>15:36:21</strong>, <em>Student 5</em>: <span class="citation" data-cites="Student">@Student</span> 6: thanks :)</p>
<p><strong>15:36:49</strong>, <em>Student 6</em>: <span class="citation" data-cites="Student">@Student</span> 4: (#MohsenSays): Generally speaking yes, it depends on the OS strictness in terms of threat sandboxing.</p>
<p><strong>15:40:56</strong>, <em>Student 6</em>: “… for more info, check this paper out: A Taxonomy of Software Integrity Protection Techniques”</p>
<p><strong>15:46:11</strong>, <em>Student 7</em>: Thanks</p>
