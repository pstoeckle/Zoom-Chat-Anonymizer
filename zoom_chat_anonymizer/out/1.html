<p><strong>14:14:28</strong>, <em>Student 0</em>: k</p>
<p><strong>14:16:32</strong>, <em>Student 1</em>: can confirm, worked well</p>
<p><strong>14:25:05</strong>, <em>Student 2</em>: Just set up a Telegram group. Feel free to join at: <a href="https://t.me/joinchat/GhURghdVDqUUjJUZh5_Luw">https://t.me/joinchat/GhURghdVDqUUjJUZh5_Luw</a></p>
<p><strong>14:28:28</strong>, <em>Student 3</em>: yes we can</p>
<p><strong>14:28:30</strong>, <em>Student 4</em>: yes</p>
<p><strong>14:28:32</strong>, <em>Student 5</em>: yes</p>
<p><strong>14:28:35</strong>, <em>Student 6</em>: yes</p>
<p><strong>14:28:36</strong>, <em>Student 7</em>: yes</p>
<p><strong>14:28:36</strong>, <em>Student 8</em>: Face is visible</p>
<p><strong>14:28:41</strong>, <em>Student 9</em>: all good</p>
<p><strong>14:33:11</strong>, <em>Student 3</em>: I didn’t exactly understood what entropy in this context means</p>
<p><strong>14:36:07</strong>, <em>Patrick Stöckle</em>: Entropy:</p>
<p><strong>14:39:41</strong>, <em>Patrick Stöckle</em>: Idea is here is that we have two inputs to a system and the system contains a secret . The attacker can measure whatever she wants; this is what we subsume with entropy. In the end, whatever she can measure should not reveal the secret .</p>
<p><strong>14:52:26</strong>, <em>Student 10</em>: I’m wondering if this class is recorded and given later or not.</p>
<p><strong>14:52:43</strong>, <em>Student 11</em>: yes, it is</p>
<p><strong>14:52:48</strong>, <em>Student 12</em>: It is being recorded.</p>
<p><strong>14:53:00</strong>, <em>Student 10</em>: Thanks :_</p>
<p><strong>14:53:01</strong>, <em>Student 10</em>: :)</p>
<p><strong>15:02:48</strong>, <em>Student 13</em>: is audio really bad for anyone else?</p>
<p><strong>15:03:00</strong>, <em>Student 14</em>: Audio is fine for me</p>
<p><strong>15:03:00</strong>, <em>Student 14</em>: fine for me</p>
<p><strong>15:03:01</strong>, <em>Student 15</em>: Fine for me</p>
<p><strong>15:03:07</strong>, <em>Student 16</em>: fine for me, too</p>
<p><strong>15:03:10</strong>, <em>Student 17</em>: fine for me</p>
<p><strong>15:03:12</strong>, <em>Student 18</em>: fine for me</p>
<p><strong>15:03:25</strong>, <em>Student 19</em>: Why is the recording stopped when answering questions? Could these not be relevant when re-watchting the lecture as well?</p>
<p><strong>15:04:32</strong>, <em>Student 19</em>: I would appreciate that, yes - if no one is too opposed, of course</p>
<p><strong>15:04:44</strong>, <em>Student 20</em>: +1</p>
<p><strong>15:04:45</strong>, <em>Student 21</em>: I would appreciate it too</p>
<p><strong>15:04:52</strong>, <em>Student 4</em>: +1</p>
<p><strong>15:04:56</strong>, <em>Student 5</em>: +1</p>
<p><strong>15:05:11</strong>, <em>Student 22</em>: +</p>
<p><strong>15:05:17</strong>, <em>Student 7</em>: +1</p>
<p><strong>15:05:45</strong>, <em>Student 19</em>: awesome, thank you very much :)</p>
<p><strong>15:12:23</strong>, <em>Student 23</em>: Could you give an example of an “injection”-attack? I couldn’t quite envision it</p>
<p><strong>15:13:15</strong>, <em>Student 24</em>: For example putting OR. 1==1 — in a password field. If not checked, it could resolve to True and grant access to the system</p>
<p><strong>15:13:27</strong>, <em>Student 25</em>: I’d have a YouTube video of Jim Manico about the OWASP top 10. He explains the injection attack, as well as other approaches, quite well.</p>
<p><strong>15:13:27</strong>, <em>Student 1</em>: You have an entry field for a name, a bad user enters “name; drop table users;” If the system is badly designed, it can happen that this string is directly injected into a SQL query and the “;” will stop the first stamen and then execute the statement “drop table users;”</p>
<p><strong>15:14:11</strong>, <em>Student 23</em>: Thank you! The 1==1 was a pretty effective example</p>
<p><strong>15:20:00</strong>, <em>Student 26</em>: Will the tutorials also be recorded?</p>
<p><strong>15:23:57</strong>, <em>Patrick Stöckle</em>: We’re planning to record the tutorials as well.</p>
<p><strong>15:31:46</strong>, <em>Student 19</em>: Is the first goal (that attackers should not be able to look at the code on the token generator) not security through obscurity? Or am I misunderstanding this?</p>
<p><strong>15:36:46</strong>, <em>Patrick Stöckle</em>: The security though obscurity anti-principle is something we will discuss later. The idea of Open Design is that many people, e.g., security researchers, can investigate in your algorithm to find flaws.</p>
<p><strong>15:37:06</strong>, <em>Student 19</em>: okay, thank you</p>
<p><strong>15:37:16</strong>, <em>Patrick Stöckle</em>: Here, we want to motivate another problem. You’ve developed a software which has to run on the client’s PC.</p>
<p><strong>15:37:55</strong>, <em>Patrick Stöckle</em>: Furthermore, your software contains something you want protect, e.g., a patented algorithm.</p>
<p><strong>15:38:41</strong>, <em>Student 19</em>: Yes, I see where you’re going - makes sense to me now</p>
<p><strong>15:38:50</strong>, <em>Patrick Stöckle</em>: How can you make it as hard as possible for a customer/attacker to extract the algorithm?</p>
<p><strong>15:38:51</strong>, <em>Student 27</em>: what prerequisites does this module have?</p>
<p><strong>15:39:07</strong>, <em>Student 6</em>: Will we be writing code eg. C++ in this class to implement our „running example“ ?</p>
<p><strong>15:41:57</strong>, <em>Patrick Stöckle</em>: We plan to make the exercises as interactive as possible. Thus, during the exercises, we encourage you to write code. Nevertheless,</p>
<p><strong>15:42:54</strong>, <em>Student 28</em>: How different is the course this semester compared to when offered earlier?</p>
<p><strong>15:42:58</strong>, <em>Patrick Stöckle</em>: Nevertheless, you do not have to implement a running online banking system or something similar.</p>
<p><strong>15:48:28</strong>, <em>Student 12</em>: Thankyou!</p>
<p><strong>15:48:29</strong>, <em>Student 29</em>: Thank you Professor!</p>
<p><strong>15:48:32</strong>, <em>Student 30</em>: Thanks</p>

<p><strong>15:48:42</strong>, <em>Student 19</em>: thank you</p>
<p><strong>15:48:45</strong>, <em>Student 39</em>: Thank you!</p>
<p><strong>15:48:46</strong>, <em>Student 40</em>: thanks</p>
<p><strong>15:48:47</strong>, <em>Student 6</em>: Thank you very nice introduction</p>
