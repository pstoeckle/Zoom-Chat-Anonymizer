<p><strong>15:21:37</strong>, <em>Student 0</em>: I think adversarial ML models (for Image detection) change more than just one Pixel - it’s just really small pertubations on many Pixels so that they aren’t visible for the human eye</p>
<p><strong>15:22:12</strong>, <em>Student 1</em>: Is it only me or is only the second part (Intrusion) of the new chapter uploaded on moodle?</p>
<p><strong>15:22:20</strong>, <em>Student 2</em>: same here</p>
<p><strong>15:22:27</strong>, <em>Student 0</em>: yep</p>
<p><strong>15:27:44</strong>, <em>Student 3</em>: the slides in moodle are the IDS slides (next lecture) under the wrong name as it seems…</p>
<p><strong>15:28:52</strong>, <em>Student 0</em>: ah nice now I see them too</p>
<p><strong>15:28:56</strong>, <em>Student 0</em>: thanks</p>
<p><strong>15:30:13</strong>, <em>Patrick Stöckle</em>: <span class="citation" data-cites="Student">@Student</span> 1: I updated moodle. Now, there should be misconfiguration and intrusion detection systems</p>
<p><strong>15:30:54</strong>, <em>Student 1</em>: thx</p>
<p><strong>15:31:30</strong>, <em>Student 4</em>: thanks!</p>
