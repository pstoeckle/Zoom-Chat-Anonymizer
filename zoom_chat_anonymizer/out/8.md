**14:45:14**, *Student 0*: downpour

**14:46:43**, *Patrick Stöckle*: @Student 0: what do you mean by that? Shall we slow down the speed of the lecture?

**14:46:48**, *Student 1*: If your application has to communicate with a database, what would be the best practice to keep the database credentials secret? We learned that there is the keystore system on Android, but what about other platforms? **Answered by Prof. Pretschner**

**14:48:31**, *Student 0*: no sorry, was talking with a friend about the weather

**14:51:34**, *Student 1*: Thank you! :)

**15:04:40**, *Student 2*: Are there ways to merge checking and responding? Such that even upon a 'successful' check, the response cannot simply be replaced by `if (false) respond();` ? **Answered by Prof. Pretschner**

**15:07:10**, *Student 3*: Is it the task of a programmer to come up with the checkers or are they usually generated and hidden by another program? **Answered by Prof. Pretschner**

**15:07:59**, *Student 4*: are those Tools open source? or somewhere available

**15:12:11**, *Patrick Stöckle*: @Student 4: Most of the software developed at our chair is open-source software. You can find most of them on our Software page ([https://www.in.tum.de/i04/tools/),](https://www.in.tum.de/i04/tools/),) e.g., for Oblivious hashing ([https://github.com/tum-i22/sip-oblivious-hashing).](https://github.com/tum-i22/sip-oblivious-hashing).)

**15:13:17**, *Student 4*: tyy

**15:21:23**, *Student 5*: Can self-checksumming be used in languages that don't compile to machine instructions? E.g. JVM-based languages, Javascript, Python.

**15:30:34**, *Student 4*: is it possible to stackwalk the stack of another thread in the same process? So if we have 1 thread doing Integrity checks can it Access another threads stack

**15:35:23**, *Student 6*: @Student 5: Answer from Mohsen (our colleague who researchers this particular topic): "Question 1. Generally yes. One realisation would be to run integrity checks within the interpreter or hypervisor."

**15:36:21**, *Student 5*: @Student 6: thanks :)

**15:36:49**, *Student 6*: @Student 4: (#MohsenSays): Generally speaking yes, it depends on the OS strictness in terms of threat sandboxing.

**15:40:56**, *Student 6*: "... for more info, check this paper out: A Taxonomy of Software Integrity Protection Techniques"

**15:46:11**, *Student 7*: Thanks
