<p><strong>14:16:33</strong>, <em>Student 1</em>: ping</p>
<p><strong>14:28:40</strong>, <em>Student 2</em>: Why do we talk about “users”, “userId”? Can a smartphone be used by multiple users? Basically is UID of an App just its ID?</p>
<p><strong>14:32:39</strong>, <em>Student 3</em>: Since Android is built on Linux, they reuse the concept of users that is available in Linux. Each app will get its own Linux user.</p>
<p><strong>14:33:04</strong>, <em>Student 4</em>: <span class="citation" data-cites="Student">@Student</span> 2: Yes, but in order to leverage the Linux kernel’s isolation model, the UID needs to be used per app to isolate each app. So, instead of having to implement a new isolation model with an arbitrary ID, just use UID’s.</p>
<p><strong>14:33:10</strong>, <em>Student 4</em>: <span class="citation" data-cites="Student">@Student</span> 3: +1</p>
<p><strong>15:13:36</strong>, <em>Student 0</em>: Are the links in the slides clickable? For me it does not work</p>
<p><strong>15:16:05</strong>, <em>Student 4</em>: <span class="citation" data-cites="Student">@Student</span> 0: I just checked the slides on moodle and it seems that some links are not clickable. Will address that; no worries.</p>
<p><strong>15:24:12</strong>, <em>Student 5</em>: but isn’t Software obfuscation just slowing down the attack rather than really stopping it? Since the junkcode wouldn’t really change the flow of the Software but only the way of executing it. if i’m not mistaken it adds a few unnecessary steps, which don’t really affect the flow in the end. So isn’t a Software product that relies on it being obfuscated violating kerckhoffs’s principle?</p>
<p><strong>15:25:23</strong>, <em>Student 4</em>: <span class="citation" data-cites="Student">@Student</span> 5: Correct. Obfuscation usually has a performance overhead. It also implements security by obscurity, which should not be the approach to security. However …</p>
<p><strong>15:25:56</strong>, <em>Student 4</em>: in some cases, businesses (e.g., game developers) would want to slow down the process of RE-ing and cracking their software until they make the break-even profit they want.</p>
<p><strong>15:26:43</strong>, <em>Student 4</em>: So, it is a method to slow down the inevitable. That said, obfuscation should NOT be the only security mechanism to be employed to secure your assets. It’s just yet another hurdle you put in front of the attacker (i.e., Defense-in-depth)</p>
<p><strong>15:29:31</strong>, <em>Student 5</em>: So security in a nutshell is the process of throwing Stones and hurdles at the attacker to annoy him/her and waste his time till he gets so annoyed and make it so time consuming to circumveit that it’s not worth his/her time?</p>
<p><strong>15:32:41</strong>, <em>Student 4</em>: <span class="citation" data-cites="Student">@Student</span> 5: In my humble opinion, yes. It is usually a matter of time before security is broken. So, if you cannot stop attackers, at least slow them down. :)</p>
<p><strong>15:33:57</strong>, <em>Patrick Stöckle</em>: <span class="citation" data-cites="Student">@Student</span> 5: For the systems and techniques, we are currently using: yes.  Maybe in the future, we will have the methods/tools/techniques/magic to to proof certain security properties for <em>real</em> systems.</p>
<p><strong>15:42:35</strong>, <em>Student 3</em>: Are these obfuscations actually done on the source-code level or is the C code just used for illustration purposes? if so, won’t compilers optimize away unnecessary expressions?</p>
<p><strong>15:43:27</strong>, <em>Student 5</em>: you’d usually use programs like vmprotect and themida (obfuscators) on the compiled pe file, not in the Sourcecode. if you use c Code at least. idk About Java applications</p>
<p><strong>15:43:38</strong>, <em>Student 3</em>: Nevermind, was answered just now.</p>
<p><strong>15:44:09</strong>, <em>Student 3</em>: <span class="citation" data-cites="Student">@Student</span> 5: thanks</p>
<p><strong>15:46:47</strong>, <em>Student 6</em>: Is obfuscation also possible in high performance environments? Because we add a lot of unnecessary code which slows down the whole execution ? <strong>Answered by Prof. Pretschner</strong></p>
<p><strong>15:47:05</strong>, <em>Student 7</em>: is that (obfuscation via opaque predicates) something I would add manually or do programs do that for me? <strong>Answered by Prof. Pretschner</strong></p>
<p><strong>15:48:10</strong>, <em>Student 3</em>: Can you fingerprint known opaque predicates? <strong>Answered by Prof. Pretschner</strong></p>
