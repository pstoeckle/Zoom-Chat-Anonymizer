**14:16:15**, *Student 0*: ping

**14:24:42**, *Student 1*: am I the only one not hearing anything suddenly?

**14:25:03**, *Student 2*: its fine for me

**14:25:07**, *Student 3*: +1

**14:25:12**, *Student 3*: for fine

**14:25:13**, *Student 1*: ty

**14:34:33**, *Student 4*: are there known cases of successful tamperings of one of these Hardware Chips?

**14:39:08**, *Patrick Stöckle*: @Student 4: From Mohsen: TPM does not stand dynamic attacks. I do not know of published attacks, definitely side channel attacks.

**15:04:52**, *Student 5*: How does the tpm chip interact with the intel management engine?

**15:20:34**, *Student 3*: There is one example that I cannot resist sharing which shows that sidechannel is brainchild of limitless imagination ... data sniffing because of thermal emissions of hardware

**15:20:40**, *Student 3*: [https://arxiv.org/abs/1503.07919](https://arxiv.org/abs/1503.07919)

**15:20:43**, *Student 3*: quite funny

**15:24:11**, *Patrick Stöckle*: @Student 3: BitWhisper and other astonishing attacks published by Guri et al. will be discussed later in this lecture.

**15:24:56**, *Student 3*: ahh I see.. that's great

**15:26:20**, *Patrick Stöckle*: Nevertheless, if you know other good papers in the context of side-channel attacks, feel free to share them either in the chat, the forum, or via private mail to me.

**15:27:43**, *Student 3*: sure thing
