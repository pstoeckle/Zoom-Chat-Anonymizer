<p><strong>14:19:32</strong>, <em>Student 0</em>: Not related to Fuzzing: Do we have to be able to perform a Padding Oracle Attack for the exam?</p>
<p><strong>14:31:31</strong>, <em>Patrick Stöckle</em>: <span class="citation" data-cites="Student">@Student</span> 0: I haven’t thought about this so far but this is a nice idea for an exam exercise ;) Jokes aside: If we asked you to perform a POA, we would provide you with the necessary formulas. We don’t expect that you are able to derive the formula, i.e., <span class="math inline"><em>P</em><sub><em>i</em></sub>[<em>n</em>] =  ⊕ <em>P</em><sub><em>i</em></sub>[<em>n</em>]′ ⊕ <em>C</em><sub><em>i</em></sub>[<em>n</em>]′ ⊕ <em>C</em><sub><em>i</em> − 1</sub>[<em>n</em>]</span> we used to crack the plain text from the CBC definition and we don’t expect that you learn the formula by heart.</p>
<p><strong>14:34:01</strong>, <em>Student 1</em>: Also not about fuzzing: Would you say that Single Sign On (e.g. google, Facebook, etc.) violates the security principle of Least Common Mechanism?</p>
<p><strong>14:35:06</strong>, <em>Student 0</em>: Thanks!</p>
<p><strong>14:40:33</strong>, <em>Patrick Stöckle</em>: <span class="citation" data-cites="Student">@Student</span> 1: I just looked up the original definition of the principle and based on this, I would say: yes, it’s violated by SSO. For SSO, I would argue with the principle that mechanisms have to be economically reasonable and the psycholog. In most of the cases</p>
<p><strong>14:42:32</strong>, <em>Patrick Stöckle</em>: and the psychological acceptability. In most of the cases, it’s more economical to move the password handling and authorisation to the SSO provider instead of implementing — and maybe messing it up — by ourselves. Furthermore, it might be more acceptable for the users to sign in with their Google account instead of creating a new password. Does this answer your question?</p>
<p><strong>14:43:16</strong>, <em>Student 1</em>: Absolutely, thanks for the effort!</p>
<p><strong>15:36:06</strong>, <em>Student 0</em>: If you’re interested in Web App pentesting, definitely check out intercepting proxies like OWASP ZAP.</p>
<p><strong>15:36:28</strong>, <em>Student 2</em>: please keep more space between last tutorial and exam in the future. I have exams today, tomorrow and so on already.</p>
