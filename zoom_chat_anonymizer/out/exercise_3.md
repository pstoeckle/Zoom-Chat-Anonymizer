**14:15:21**, *Student 0*: we can hear you

**14:22:59**, *Student 1*: Actually what we see is just black

**14:23:14**, *Student 2*: i can see him and the slides

**14:23:18**, *Student 3*: me too

**14:23:21**, *Student 4*: Works fine here

**14:24:33**, *Student 5*: since every process has just 1 address space, but potentially multiple threads how are the stacks of the threads seperated? Is it possible to manipulate the stack of a different thread?

**14:28:29**, *Student 6*: how do we know adr to CanNever?

**14:29:37**, *Student 5*: if you inject the function to the vuln application you'd have to allocate Memory. The Windows function you use to allocate Memory will return the address of the allocated Memory and there by the startaddress of your shellcode. Besides that you can work with Offsets of your function

**14:30:13**, *Patrick StÃ¶ckle*: @Student 5: I donâ€™t know right know, if there is any possibility to overwrite the stack of a different thread. My first guess would be **no**, but I will research that after the class.

**14:30:52**, *Student 2*: @Student 6: when ASLR is not in place, the address of a function will always be as stated in the executable file.

**14:42:24**, *Student 7*: what api level is the app and is it relevant for this exercise?

**15:37:46**, *Student 8*: can you make a list of all attacks we did in this tutorial?

**15:38:35**, *Student 8*: cause im losing the overview a bit

**15:38:58**, *Student 9*: +1

**15:39:18**, *Student 10*: +1

**15:39:37**, *Student 11*: +1

**15:46:04**, *Student 8*: that would be great, thanks

**15:46:28**, *Student 2*: your voice quality is acutally quite acceptable

**15:46:37**, *Student 2*: thanks ðŸ‘‹
