<p><strong>14:16:15</strong>, <em>Student 0</em>: ping</p>
<p><strong>14:24:42</strong>, <em>Student 1</em>: am I the only one not hearing anything suddenly?</p>
<p><strong>14:25:03</strong>, <em>Student 2</em>: its fine for me</p>
<p><strong>14:25:07</strong>, <em>Student 3</em>: +1</p>
<p><strong>14:25:12</strong>, <em>Student 3</em>: for fine</p>
<p><strong>14:25:13</strong>, <em>Student 1</em>: ty</p>
<p><strong>14:34:33</strong>, <em>Student 4</em>: are there known cases of successful tamperings of one of these Hardware Chips?</p>
<p><strong>14:39:08</strong>, <em>Patrick Stöckle</em>: <span class="citation" data-cites="Student">@Student</span> 4: From Mohsen: TPM does not stand dynamic attacks. I do not know of published attacks, definitely side channel attacks.</p>
<p><strong>15:04:52</strong>, <em>Student 5</em>: How does the tpm chip interact with the intel management engine?</p>
<p><strong>15:20:34</strong>, <em>Student 3</em>: There is one example that I cannot resist sharing which shows that sidechannel is brainchild of limitless imagination … data sniffing because of thermal emissions of hardware</p>
<p><strong>15:20:40</strong>, <em>Student 3</em>: <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1503.07919">https://arxiv.org/abs/1503.07919</a></p>
<p><strong>15:20:43</strong>, <em>Student 3</em>: quite funny</p>
<p><strong>15:24:11</strong>, <em>Patrick Stöckle</em>: <span class="citation" data-cites="Student">@Student</span> 3: BitWhisper and other astonishing attacks published by Guri et al. will be discussed later in this lecture.</p>
<p><strong>15:24:56</strong>, <em>Student 3</em>: ahh I see.. that’s great</p>
<p><strong>15:26:20</strong>, <em>Patrick Stöckle</em>: Nevertheless, if you know other good papers in the context of side-channel attacks, feel free to share them either in the chat, the forum, or via private mail to me.</p>
<p><strong>15:27:43</strong>, <em>Student 3</em>: sure thing</p>
