<p><strong>14:16:14</strong>, <em>Student 0</em>: ping</p>
<p><strong>14:28:24</strong>, <em>Student 1</em>: How would one go about extracting data from a frozen memory stick? And why is it easier to find secrets that way?</p>
<p><strong>14:39:13</strong>, <em>Patrick St√∂ckle</em>: <span class="citation" data-cites="Student">@Student</span> 1: The idea is the following: You know that your victim is working with some delicate information, e.g., a private key. During the operation, the private key has to be loaded into the memory at some point. Usually, this non-permanent memory is lost after a couple of seconds. Thus, after a shutdown, our victim thinks that their data is secure again. In this moment, we steal the freshly shutdown laptop and put it directly in some cool pack. Through the cold temperatures, the information on the non-permanent memory can be extracted even minutes after the shutdown. Thus, we might be able to extract the private key.</p>
<p><strong>14:40:13</strong>, <em>Student 1</em>: Okay I understand now, thank you!</p>
<p><strong>15:04:03</strong>, <em>Student 2</em>: any problem with the streaming? My system told me twice that my connectivity was bad.</p>
<p><strong>15:04:44</strong>, <em>Student 1</em>: For me it was a little bit distorted at some points, but that might be my connection as well</p>
