<p><strong>14:16:00</strong>, <em>Student 0</em>: ping</p>
<p><strong>14:44:15</strong>, <em>Student 1</em>: Just to be sure, are the Bonus slides exam relevant?</p>
<p><strong>14:45:45</strong>, <em>Student 2</em>: Not technically, no. You won’t be asked, for example, what are the attacks that can be launched against Location-based K-anonymity. But the abstract ideas may be referenced in the exams as a use case, for instance.</p>
<p><strong>14:46:02</strong>, <em>Student 1</em>: Okay, thank you</p>
<p><strong>14:46:36</strong>, <em>Student 2</em>: Sure thing.</p>
<p><strong>14:55:37</strong>, <em>Student 3</em>: In Germany, according to BITKOM, 57 % of people used a smartphone in 2018: <a href="https://www.bitkom.org/sites/default/files/file/import/Bitkom-Pressekonferenz-Smartphone-Markt-22-02-2018-Praesentation-final.pdf">https://www.bitkom.org/sites/default/files/file/import/Bitkom-Pressekonferenz-Smartphone-Markt-22-02-2018-Praesentation-final.pdf</a></p>
<p><strong>14:56:16</strong>, <em>Student 3</em>: Sorry, 57 million people, so 68 %.</p>
<p><strong>14:57:02</strong>, <em>Student 3</em>: For people 65 and above, it’s a mere 41 % though.</p>
<p><strong>14:59:38</strong>, <em>Student 1</em>: A Problem is not only that many People don’t have a Smartphone, but the app is also not compatible with older iOS/Android versions</p>
<p><strong>15:00:28</strong>, <em>Student 3</em>: You are absolutely right, and it’s not entirely clear to me why. I heard that apparently only 50 % of smartphones are even compatible with the app.</p>
<p><strong>15:01:44</strong>, <em>Patrick Stöckle</em>: <span class="citation" data-cites="Student">@Student</span> 1: From <a href="https://www.coronawarn.app/en/faq/#most_asked:">https://www.coronawarn.app/en/faq/#most_asked:</a> Apple introduced the required Exposure Notification API with iOS 13.5, see About iOS 13 Updates. You can find the supported devices here: Supported iPhone Models. Unfortunately, Apple no longer supports devices that are older than 4-5 years. We as app developers, unfortunately, cannot influence this.</p>
<p><strong>15:02:13</strong>, <em>Patrick Stöckle</em>: Android: Why are Android 6 and Google Play Services minimum requirements?</p>
<p><strong>15:02:19</strong>, <em>Patrick Stöckle</em>: Google delivers the required Exposure Notification API for contact tracing apps with Google Play Services. The API is supported starting with Android API level 23. This version is available starting with Android version 6.0, see Codenames, Tags, and Build Numbers. This was decided solely by Google. In addition, older devices sometimes don’t support Bluetooth Low Energy. We as app developers, unfortunately, cannot influence this.</p>
<p><strong>15:03:51</strong>, <em>Patrick Stöckle</em>: So it’s more a technical problem that (1) some old devices do not support BLE and (2) that old devices are no longer supported by Apple/Google.</p>
<p><strong>15:11:00</strong>, <em>Student 4</em>: What’s the difference between <em>dark</em> and <em>Deep web</em>? I’ve heard both expressions used interchangably</p>
<p><strong>15:12:54</strong>, <em>Student 4</em>: nvm i googled it, thanks anyway :D</p>
<p><strong>15:14:26</strong>, <em>Student 5</em>: Tor Browser protects against fingerprinting btw <em>Remark: This is right! This was a mistake in the audio of the lecture.</em></p>
<p><strong>15:20:10</strong>, <em>Student 6</em>: what are your thoughts on FIDO2?</p>
<p><strong>15:20:16</strong>, <em>Patrick Stöckle</em>: <span class="citation" data-cites="Student">@Student</span> 4: <em>Dark web</em> is usually used when it comes to hidden services and anything related to the TOR network. With <em>deep web</em>, we usually denote everything which is not indexed by search engines. Sometimes, the content is not indexed because the services is a hidden service, but there can be also other reason that the crawlers can not index the site.</p>
<p><strong>15:20:37</strong>, <em>Student 4</em>: any idea why the hacker sat on the stolen data for 8 years instead of selling it Right away?</p>
<p><strong>15:21:07</strong>, <em>Student 4</em>: Thanks for the info! <span class="citation" data-cites="Patrick">@Patrick</span> :) That’s what confused me. I think many People don’t know the difference and use the wrong term</p>
<p><strong>15:24:25</strong>, <em>Patrick Stöckle</em>: <span class="citation" data-cites="Student">@Student</span> 4: Yes, these two terms are sometimes used as synonyms of each other. This is why I used the weak statement of <em>usually</em> above. Especially in non-technical news article, you also might find the term <em>deep web</em>, although they really are referring to the so-called <em>dark web</em>.</p>
<p><strong>15:26:47</strong>, <em>Patrick Stöckle</em>: <span class="citation" data-cites="Student">@Student</span> 4: I don’t really know, why the data was offered in 2016. My speculations would be: Maybe it was used for 8 years secretly before the attackers decided that they have milked it enough and put it only for sale to make some extra money.</p>
<p><strong>15:32:44</strong>, <em>Patrick Stöckle</em>: <span class="citation" data-cites="Student">@Student</span> 6: I’m personally not using a FIDO2 key nor am I familiar enough with the protocol to give a strong verdict about it. Nevertheless, I’m not aware of any threatening attack on the FIDO2 approach. Thus, I think it should be ok and it’s certainly more secure than an insecure password. If anybody has more experience with FIDO2, feel free to share this with us and your colleagues here or later in the forum.</p>
<p><strong>15:32:46</strong>, <em>Student 2</em>: <span class="citation" data-cites="Student">@Student</span> 6: re: FIDO2, I personally have not delved into the nitty gritty details of it. But it seems interesting at least from a user perspective. But at the end of the day, you’re shifting from a something you know model to a something you have. Granted it is more difficult to attack. However, just like any new technologies, it will introduce its own set of problems and attacks. Still, I am pretty excited to see where that goes.</p>
<p><strong>15:34:45</strong>, <em>Student 6</em>: <span class="citation" data-cites="Patrick">@Patrick</span>: <span class="citation" data-cites="Student">@Student</span> 2: Thank you for your opinions! :)</p>
<p><strong>15:38:39</strong>, <em>Student 2</em>: <span class="citation" data-cites="Student">@Student</span> 6: sure. I was just thinking about it a bit and thought that instead of people writing their passwords on post-it notes or something and leaving it on their desks, they will probably leave the FIDO2 USB keys plugged into their computers or leave their phones either unlocked or with a weak pin/pattern. Not to mention the physical attacks of pick-pocketting or mugging or though, if you’re a high-profile user. Still, technically it is an interesting initiative. :)</p>
<p><strong>15:40:52</strong>, <em>Student 6</em>: yes, I agree, probably in the end it would just shift to more “physical” attacks as you state… Maybe in 30 years or so, These “Chips” will be implanted into the Skin then <em>thinking</em> :D</p>
<p><strong>15:43:06</strong>, <em>Student 0</em>: wouldn’t single point of failure be another disadvantage? Somehow find the Google/FB Password =&gt; access to many services</p>
<p><strong>15:45:37</strong>, <em>Patrick Stöckle</em>: <span class="citation" data-cites="Student">@Student</span> 0: The idea we wanted to mention here is the following. If you’re a small company, the risk that you mess up the password storage might be higher than the risk of abuse of the Google FB password</p>
<p><strong>15:45:43</strong>, <em>Student 4</em>: thanks :)</p>
