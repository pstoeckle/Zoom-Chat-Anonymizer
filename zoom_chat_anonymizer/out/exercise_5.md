**14:22:53**, *Student 2*: Slide 7: Why does it say „goto *h“ at the end instead of „goto *start“? Aren’t we supposed to jump to the start of the program and execute it after self checksumming? **Answered by Mohsen**

**14:23:50**, *Student 3*: Will the solutions be uploaded after the tutorial is over?

**14:24:25**, *Patrick Stöckle*: @Student 3: Yes, we will upload the slides to Moodle.

**14:24:48**, *Student 3*: ok thanks

**14:25:24**, *Student 2*: Thanks!

**15:30:31**, *Student 8*: [https://github.com/mr-ma/basic-self-checksumming](https://github.com/mr-ma/basic-self-checksumming)

**15:58:45**, *Student 5*: so can a patchfunction never patch itself

**16:00:20**, *Student 9*: Thank you!
