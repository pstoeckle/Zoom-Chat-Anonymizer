**14:14:28**, *Student 0*: k

**14:16:32**, *Student 1*: can confirm, worked well

**14:25:05**, *Student 2*: Just set up a Telegram group. Feel free to join at: [https://t.me/joinchat/GhURghdVDqUUjJUZh5_Luw](https://t.me/joinchat/GhURghdVDqUUjJUZh5_Luw)

**14:28:28**, *Student 3*: yes we can

**14:28:30**, *Student 4*: yes

**14:28:32**, *Student 5*: yes

**14:28:35**, *Student 6*: yes

**14:28:36**, *Student 7*: yes

**14:28:36**, *Student 8*: Face is visible

**14:28:41**, *Student 9*: all good

**14:33:11**, *Student 3*: I didn't exactly understood what entropy in this context means

**14:36:07**, *Patrick Stöckle*: Entropy:

**14:39:41**, *Patrick Stöckle*: Idea is here is that we have two inputs to a system and the system contains a secret \epsilon. The attacker can measure whatever she wants; this is what we subsume with entropy. In the end, whatever she can measure should not reveal the secret \epsilon.

**14:52:26**, *Student 10*: I'm wondering if this class is recorded and given later or not.

**14:52:43**, *Student 11*: yes, it is

**14:52:48**, *Student 12*: It is being recorded.

**14:53:00**, *Student 10*: Thanks :_

**14:53:01**, *Student 10*: :)

**15:02:48**, *Student 13*: is audio really bad for anyone else?

**15:03:00**, *Student 14*: Audio is fine for me

**15:03:00**, *Student 14*: fine for me

**15:03:01**, *Student 15*: Fine for me

**15:03:07**, *Student 16*: fine for me, too

**15:03:10**, *Student 17*: fine for me

**15:03:12**, *Student 18*: fine for me

**15:03:25**, *Student 19*: Why is the recording stopped when answering questions? Could these not be relevant when re-watchting the lecture as well?

**15:04:32**, *Student 19*: I would appreciate that, yes - if no one is too opposed, of course

**15:04:44**, *Student 20*: +1

**15:04:45**, *Student 21*: I would appreciate it too

**15:04:52**, *Student 4*: +1

**15:04:56**, *Student 5*: +1

**15:05:11**, *Student 22*: +

**15:05:17**, *Student 7*: +1

**15:05:45**, *Student 19*: awesome, thank you very much :)

**15:12:23**, *Student 23*: Could you give an example of an "injection"-attack? I couldn't quite envision it

**15:13:15**, *Student 24*: For example putting OR. 1==1 — in a password field. If not checked, it could resolve to True and grant access to the system

**15:13:27**, *Student 25*: I'd have a YouTube video of Jim Manico about the OWASP top 10. He explains the injection attack, as well as other approaches, quite well.

**15:13:27**, *Student 1*: You have an entry field for a name, a bad user enters "name; drop table users; "
If the system is badly designed, it can happen that this string is directly injected into a SQL query and the ";" will stop the first stamen and then execute the statement "drop table users;"

**15:14:11**, *Student 23*: Thank you! The 1==1 was a pretty effective example

**15:20:00**, *Student 26*: Will the tutorials also be recorded?

**15:23:57**, *Patrick Stöckle*: We’re planning to record the tutorials as well.

**15:31:46**, *Student 19*: Is the first goal (that attackers should not be able to look at the code on the token generator) not security through obscurity? Or am I misunderstanding this?

**15:36:46**, *Patrick Stöckle*: The security though obscurity anti-principle is something we will discuss later. The idea of Open Design is that many people, e.g., security researchers, can investigate in your algorithm to find flaws.

**15:37:06**, *Student 19*: okay, thank you

**15:37:16**, *Patrick Stöckle*: Here, we want to motivate another problem. You’ve developed a software which has to run on the client’s PC.

**15:37:55**, *Patrick Stöckle*: Furthermore, your software contains something you want protect, e.g., a patented algorithm.

**15:38:41**, *Student 19*: Yes, I see where you're going - makes sense to me now

**15:38:50**, *Patrick Stöckle*: How can you make it as hard as possible for a customer/attacker to extract the algorithm?

**15:38:51**, *Student 27*: what prerequisites does this module have?

**15:39:07**, *Student 6*: Will we be writing code eg. C++ in this class to implement our „running example“ ?

**15:41:57**, *Patrick Stöckle*: We plan to make the exercises as interactive as possible. Thus, during the exercises, we encourage you to write code. Nevertheless,

**15:42:54**, *Student 28*: How different is the course this semester compared to when offered earlier?

**15:42:58**, *Patrick Stöckle*: Nevertheless, you do not have to implement a running online banking system or something similar.

**15:48:28**, *Student 12*: Thankyou!

**15:48:29**, *Student 29*: Thank you Professor!

**15:48:32**, *Student 30*: Thanks
