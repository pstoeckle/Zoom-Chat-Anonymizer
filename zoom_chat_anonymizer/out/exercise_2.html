<p><strong>14:10:27</strong>, <em>Student 0</em>: ping</p>
<p><strong>14:10:28</strong>, <em>Student 1</em>: yes</p>
<p><strong>14:10:37</strong>, <em>Student 1</em>: yes</p>
<p><strong>14:10:39</strong>, <em>Student 2</em>: yes</p>
<p><strong>14:30:08</strong>, <em>Student 3</em>: Would such a really open question be realistic for the exam?</p>
<p><strong>14:31:38</strong>, <em>Student 4</em>: <span class="citation" data-cites="Student">@Student</span> 3: not really, no. The exam is usually 90-minute long, and we cannot afford such questions there. If there are any similar questions, they will be designed to fit within the exam time.</p>
<p><strong>14:31:51</strong>, <em>Student 3</em>: okay good</p>
<p><strong>14:37:18</strong>, <em>Student 3</em>: Off-Topic: Does one have to know PHP for the exam?</p>
<p><strong>14:37:53</strong>, <em>Student 3</em>: Not that it would be rather complicated but personally never bothered to learn as it’s so old</p>
<p><strong>14:37:59</strong>, <em>Student 4</em>: <span class="citation" data-cites="Student">@Student</span> 3: A little bit. Just enough to understand code snippets and identify the vulnerable parts in them.</p>
<p><strong>14:43:09</strong>, <em>Student 5</em>: <span class="citation" data-cites="Student">@Student</span> 4: Just to make that more precise: How complicated would those snippets be? Comparable to the DVWA snippets for the “low” level? Or should we know basic PHP security mechanisms and secure input/output methods as well?</p>
<p><strong>14:45:21</strong>, <em>Student 4</em>: <span class="citation" data-cites="Student">@Student</span> 5: Well, in terms of DVWA difficulty, I would probably say between Low and Medium. To see how PHP defends against that, you can check the “Impossible” difficulty.</p>
<p><strong>14:46:32</strong>, <em>Student 4</em>: Depending on the question, sometimes abstract answers are accepted (e.g., use parameterized queries).</p>
<p><strong>14:47:05</strong>, <em>Student 6</em>: Do we get individual comments when we submit our exercise answers?</p>
<p><strong>14:47:09</strong>, <em>Student 6</em>: on moodle?</p>
<p><strong>14:47:57</strong>, <em>Student 4</em>: <span class="citation" data-cites="Student">@Student</span> 6: Yes, eventually. :)</p>
<p><strong>15:13:57</strong>, <em>Student 7</em>: Is it still possible to download the “Damn Vulnerable Web App” from somewhere? I had some time issues this week - after finishing the SE exercise right before this tutorial, I’m back on schedule again, but the link didn’t work any more. ^^"</p>
<p><strong>15:14:10</strong>, <em>Student 8</em>: yes</p>
<p><strong>15:14:10</strong>, <em>Student 5</em>: yes</p>
<p><strong>15:14:40</strong>, <em>Student 9</em>: <span class="citation" data-cites="Student">@Student</span> 7: i used this one <code>docker run --rm -it -p 80:80 vulnerables/web-dvwa</code></p>
<p><strong>15:14:56</strong>, <em>Student 8</em>: yes</p>
<p><strong>15:14:59</strong>, <em>Student 10</em>: yes</p>
<p><strong>15:16:29</strong>, <em>Student 4</em>: <span class="citation" data-cites="Student">@Student</span> 7: If the link doesn’t work, try downloading it from its official website (www.dvwa.co.uk). You can also acquire it as a docker container. We have not modified its source code.</p>
<p><strong>15:17:43</strong>, <em>Student 7</em>: Oh, okay. Thank you. :) It somehow reminds me of hackthissite.org.</p>
<p><strong>15:19:13</strong>, <em>Student 4</em>: <span class="citation" data-cites="Student">@Student</span> 7: Speaking of which, you can try and play with JuiceShop (<a href="https://owasp.org/www-project-juice-shop/">https://owasp.org/www-project-juice-shop/)</a>) or Zero Bank (http://zero.webappsecurity.com/) for a more believable scenario.</p>
<p><strong>15:21:08</strong>, <em>Student 7</em>: Heard of these, never tried. Will give it a shot when I have more time at my hands. :) Thank you.</p>
<p><strong>15:22:58</strong>, <em>Student 11</em>: +1 for OWASP Juice Shop. Alongside Portswigger’s Web Security Academy it’s the best hands-on web sec “learning platform” I know of.</p>
<p><strong>15:24:32</strong>, <em>Student 7</em>: The list of URLs to post into the TMHC “infosec students” channel gets longer. :D</p>
<p><strong>15:26:40</strong>, <em>Student 3</em>: He meant to the user id =‘ge’ is always false right?</p>
<p><strong>15:27:34</strong>, <em>Student 6</em>: without it, it will always return true regardless of the version check</p>
<p><strong>15:28:00</strong>, <em>Student 3</em>: yeah i know but i think he said its always true</p>
<p><strong>15:45:09</strong>, <em>Student 12</em>: The upcoming exercise 3.3 requires genymotion, which in turn requires a registered account. Is there an alternative to that or do we have to register to solve the exercise?</p>
<p><strong>15:46:25</strong>, <em>Student 4</em>: <span class="citation" data-cites="Student">@Student</span> 12: The account registration should be free of charge. Still, if you wish not to register, you can install the APK of the app on any emulator you like.</p>
<p><strong>15:46:32</strong>, <em>Student 4</em>: Something like the SDK emulator.</p>
<p><strong>15:46:45</strong>, <em>Student 4</em>: The APK should be in the Exercise_3_Code.zip archive.</p>
<p><strong>15:46:51</strong>, <em>Student 12</em>: thank you!</p>
<p><strong>15:47:07</strong>, <em>Student 4</em>: <span class="citation" data-cites="Student">@Student</span> 12: Sure thing.</p>
