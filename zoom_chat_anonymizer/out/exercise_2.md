**14:10:27**, *Student 0*: ping

**14:10:28**, *Student 1*: yes

**14:10:37**, *Student 1*: yes

**14:10:39**, *Student 2*: yes

**14:30:08**, *Student 3*: Would such a really open question be realistic for the exam?

**14:31:38**, *Student 4*: @Student 3: not really, no. The exam is usually 90-minute long, and we cannot afford such questions there. If there are any similar questions, they will be designed to fit within the exam time.

**14:31:51**, *Student 3*: okay good

**14:37:18**, *Student 3*: Off-Topic: Does one have to know PHP for the exam?

**14:37:53**, *Student 3*: Not that it would be rather complicated but personally never bothered to learn as it’s so old

**14:37:59**, *Student 4*: @Student 3: A little bit. Just enough to understand code snippets and identify the vulnerable parts in them.

**14:43:09**, *Student 5*: @Student 4: Just to make that more precise: How complicated would those snippets be? Comparable to the DVWA snippets for the "low" level? Or should we know basic PHP security mechanisms and secure input/output methods as well?

**14:45:21**, *Student 4*: @Student 5: Well, in terms of DVWA difficulty, I would probably say between Low and Medium. To see how PHP defends against that, you can check the "Impossible" difficulty.

**14:46:32**, *Student 4*: Depending on the question, sometimes abstract answers are accepted (e.g., use parameterized queries).

**14:47:05**, *Student 6*: Do we get individual comments when we submit our exercise answers?

**14:47:09**, *Student 6*: on moodle?

**14:47:57**, *Student 4*: @Student 6: Yes, eventually. :)

**15:13:57**, *Student 7*: Is it still possible to download the "Damn Vulnerable Web App" from somewhere? I had some time issues this week - after finishing the SE exercise right before this tutorial, I'm back on schedule again, but the link didn't work any more. ^^"

**15:14:10**, *Student 8*: yes

**15:14:10**, *Student 5*: yes

**15:14:40**, *Student 9*: @Student 7:  i used this one `docker run --rm -it -p 80:80 vulnerables/web-dvwa`

**15:14:56**, *Student 8*: yes

**15:14:59**, *Student 10*: yes

**15:16:29**, *Student 4*: @Student 7: If the link doesn't work, try downloading it from its official website (www.dvwa.co.uk). You can also acquire it as a docker container. We have not modified its source code.

**15:17:43**, *Student 7*: Oh, okay. Thank you. :) It somehow reminds me of hackthissite.org.

**15:19:13**, *Student 4*: @Student 7: Speaking of which, you can try and play with JuiceShop ([https://owasp.org/www-project-juice-shop/)](https://owasp.org/www-project-juice-shop/)) or Zero Bank (http://zero.webappsecurity.com/) for a more believable scenario.

**15:21:08**, *Student 7*: Heard of these, never tried. Will give it a shot when I have more time at my hands. :) Thank you.

**15:22:58**, *Student 11*: +1 for OWASP Juice Shop. Alongside Portswigger’s Web Security Academy it’s the best hands-on web sec “learning platform” I know of.

**15:24:32**, *Student 7*: The list of URLs to post into the TMHC "infosec students" channel gets longer. :D

**15:26:40**, *Student 3*: He meant to the user id =‘ge’ is always false right?

**15:27:34**, *Student 6*: without it, it will always return true regardless of the version check

**15:28:00**, *Student 3*: yeah i know but i think he said its always true

**15:45:09**, *Student 12*: The upcoming exercise 3.3 requires genymotion, which in turn requires a registered account. Is there an alternative to that or do we have to register to solve the exercise?

**15:46:25**, *Student 4*: @Student 12: The account registration should be free of charge. Still, if you wish not to register, you can install the APK of the app on any emulator you like.

**15:46:32**, *Student 4*: Something like the SDK emulator.

**15:46:45**, *Student 4*: The APK should be in the Exercise_3_Code.zip archive.

**15:46:51**, *Student 12*: thank you!

**15:47:07**, *Student 4*: @Student 12: Sure thing.
