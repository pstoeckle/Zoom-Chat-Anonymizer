<p><strong>14:15:50</strong>, <em>Student 0</em>: pong</p>
<p><strong>14:32:36</strong>, <em>Student 1</em>: Two questions regarding slide 26: What is meant with <strong>Uncertainty</strong>? What is meant by the con <strong>critical knowledge base</strong>?</p>
<p><strong>14:37:50</strong>, <em>Student 2</em>: what a weird price. 11.10 € smh</p>
<p><strong>14:39:22</strong>, <em>Patrick Stöckle</em>: <span class="citation" data-cites="Student">@Student</span> 1: <em>What is meant with “Uncertainty”?</em> There are some things we simply don’t know like. Are we considering all events that could happen? Are the probabilities we are estimating for the events correct? Etc. With uncertainty, we subsume all of this. The problem is that we have imperfect information of our work and environment and have to cope with that as good as possible.</p>
<p><strong>14:45:44</strong>, <em>Patrick Stöckle</em>: <em>What is meant by the con “critical knowledge base”?</em> If we want to calculate some number for the risk, the number will depend on the things we know and the things that we know. If we don’t consider a specific event because we did not know that this could happen, we will miscalculate the risk. Usually, we have to make an assumption of the probability of an event or calculate the probability from past events. If we make a wrong assumption of the probability or the events of the past give no good heuristic for assessing the probability in the future, we will miscalculate the risk completely.</p>
<p><strong>14:51:04</strong>, <em>Student 1</em>: Thanks for the clarifications!</p>
<p><strong>15:01:56</strong>, <em>Student 1</em>: Did I catch that right, that it’s not important to us, what the differences between a <strong>CERT</strong> and a <strong>CSIRT</strong> are?</p>
<p><strong>15:06:24</strong>, <em>Patrick Stöckle</em>: When the first response team was founded, it was named CERT. Since that time, a lot of other CERTs have been created. In other companies, these teams are called CSIRTs. There is no clear definition globally accepted to distinguish CERTs from CSIRTs. Thus, most of the time CERT and CSIRT are used as synonyms.</p>
<p><strong>15:06:52</strong>, <em>Student 1</em>: Alright, thanks!</p>
<p><strong>15:23:26</strong>, <em>Student 1</em>: Do we have to know all of the MITRE ATT&amp;CK phases by heart? <strong>Answered by Prof. Pretschner</strong></p>
<p><strong>15:23:56</strong>, <em>Student 3</em>: will there be another lecture on thursday?</p>
<p><strong>15:24:10</strong>, <em>Student 3</em>: uff</p>
<p><strong>15:24:13</strong>, <em>Student 3</em>: ok</p>
<p><strong>15:24:22</strong>, <em>Student 2</em>: Thanks for the nice class!:)</p>
<p><strong>15:25:07</strong>, <em>Student 1</em>: Thanks for the awesome class!</p>
<p><strong>15:25:21</strong>, <em>Student 4</em>: Thanks for the class</p>
<p><strong>15:25:25</strong>, <em>Student 5</em>: Thanks!</p>
<p><strong>15:25:39</strong>, <em>Student 6</em>: thanks for the class!</p>
<p><strong>15:25:46</strong>, <em>Student 7</em>: Thanks</p>
